     <p>Bill adopted the Operator Theory Seminar, and it was his main connection with the Mathematics Department for many years.  The seminar meets weekly and has been a department tradition since the 1960's.  The seminar has a casual atmosphere, and graduate students play a prominent role.  Bill often said that he wanted to be around young people.  The main attraction of the seminar to Bill, perhaps, was the opportunity to hang out with the younger crowd. Of course we were all well younger than he, so we were all part of the "younger crowd."</p>

     <p>Bill attended the Operator Theory Seminar regularly, except in bad weather.  Occasionally he would join us at a dinner for an outside speaker.  When he was driving himself, he was proud of his Gold parking sticker that allowed him to park in front of the Mathematics Building.  At first when he stopped driving, one of the members of the seminar would pick him up and take him home, occasionally going inside for more conversation.  We would sometimes get his capsule review of the day's lecture: "I liked that," or, "that seemed a bit complicated," or something to the effect that the material was not quite ready for prime time.  His critical comments, however, were never mean, and they were generally accurate.  In his last years, Odell Winston took over the driving duties, and we were grateful to her for this service. Despite his advanced years, Bill never asked for favors, but as his legs became unsteady we began to meet in Tom Kriete's office so that he would not have to climb stairs.</p>

     <p>Bill always had projects.  Once he mentioned writing something historical on the calculus of variations, his specialty.  We invited him to talk informally to the Operator Theory Seminar on this sometime.  Bill was interested and never said no, but it did not come to pass.  Nevertheless, we all marveled and felt pride that a man of ultimately 99, 100, 101, and 102 years of age was a regular in our seminar.</p>
