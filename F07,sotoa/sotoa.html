<h4>David Sherman </h4>
<h4>Why operator spaces? / Introduction to K-theory for C*-algebras </h4>
<i>(first half)</i> I'll introduce operator spaces and hopefully give some idea why they're interesting.  This is intended to prep the audience for Zarikian's talk Nov. 13, and it may all be review for attendees of Tom's course last semester.<br>
<i>(second half)</i> I'll introduce the dimension semigroup of a C*-algebra, then explain the Grothendieck construction which leads to K<sub>0</sub>.

<h4>Brent Carswell, Allegheny College </h4>
<h4>Conditional expectation, Bergman projection, and disintegration of Lebesgue area measure </h4>

<p>
Aleksandrov proved that on the space L<sup>2</sup>(<b>T</b>,<i>m</i>), where <i>m</i> denotes normalized Lebesgue measure on the unit circle <b>T</b>, the conditional expectation operator associated with a &sigma;-algebra of Lebesgue measurable subsets of <b>T</b> commutes with the Riesz projection if and only if the &sigma;-algebra is generated by an inner function.  The conditional expectation operator associated with an inner function is closely linked to the Clark-Aleksandrov measure determined by the same inner function.  In this talk, we examine the extent to which Aleksandrov's result translates to the setting of the unit disk, where <b>T</b>, <i>m</i>, and the Riesz projection are replaced by the disk, area measure, and the Bergman projection, respectively.  For this, we introduce a certain family of measures, which can be viewed as the disk version of the Clark measures.

<h4>Pietro Poggi-Corradini, Kansas State University (visiting George Mason University)</h4>
<h4>Some new versions of Schwarz's lemma using diameters, capacity and
area</h4>
 
<p>
We first recall Schwarz's lemma and its generalization using
diameter given by Landau and Toeplitz in 1907. We then give a new
proof of this result which allows to use higher diameters and even
capacity. Time permitting we will sketch what happens when using area and
we will state some open problems. This is joint with Bob Burckel, Don
Marshall, David Minda, and Tom Ransford.

<h4>Vrej Zarikian, U.S. Naval Academy</h4>
<h4>Operator spaces, multipliers, and applications</h4>

<p>
After a brief review of operator space theory we will discuss left
multipliers of operator spaces, as introduced by Blecher. These are linear
maps on the operator space which in some concrete representation of the
operator space become left multiplication by a fixed operator. We then
present a fundamental theorem of Blecher, Effros, and the speaker which
characterizes left multipliers abstractly (i.e. without reference to a
concrete representation of the operator space). As applications we give
elegant proofs of the Blecher-Ruan-Sinclair characterization of unital
(non-self-adjoint) operator algebras and a Banach-Stone theorem for such
algebras. Time permitting, we indicate how one-sided multiplier theory leads
to a one-sided M-ideal theory for operator spaces, analogous to the
(two-sided) M-ideal theory of Banach spaces introduced by Alfsen and Effros
in the 1970s.

<!-- <h4>Von Neumann algebraic <i>H<sup>p</sup></i> function theory</h4>

<p>
Around 1967, Arveson invented a striking noncommutative
generalization of <i>H<sup>&infin;</sup></i> of the disk, which includes a wide array of examples of interest to operator algebraists. Most of the talk will be on joint work with Labuschagne, in which we generalize the theory of the generalized
<i>H<sup>p</sup></i> spaces for function algebras from the 1960s, to Arveson's
von Neumann algebraic setting. The generalization is for the most
part extremely complete and literal, but the reasons why things work
are `von Neumann algebraic'. The newest results
utilize new variants of the noncommutative Szeg&ouml; theorem for
<i>L<sup>p</sup>(M)</i>, to generalize many of the classical results concerning
outer functions, to the noncommutative <i>H<sup>p</sup></i> context. In doing so we
solve several of the old open problems in the subject.

<h4>Greatest hits of C*-algebraic K-theory</h4>

<p>
Next semester Tom Kriete and I plan to lead a working seminar on this topic, based on Rordam's book.  In this talk I will try to give some idea of the main objects, the main theorems, and what can be done with them.  I will snobbishly ignore details and may even lie a little.  Like any short compilation, this will be woefully incomplete -- interested parties should buy the boxed set in the spring!
