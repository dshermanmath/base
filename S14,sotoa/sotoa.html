<p>
The seminar will not run during January because of the abundance of department colloquia meeting in our slot and at other times.  The colloquia on January 21 (Leonel Robert) and January 28 (Kostya Medynets) involve operator algebras; see the <a href = "http://pi.math.virginia.edu/colloq/">department colloquium page</a> for abstracts and other details.

<h4>Fractafolds, local homeomorphisms, and groupoids</h4>

<p>Strichartz defined a fractafold to be the equivalent of a manifold when the underlying space is a fractal instead of a Euclidean space. A particular class of fractafolds are the so-called fractafold blowups. For example, one can view the real line as a fractadold blowup of the unit interval. In this talk that is based on joint work with Alex Kumjian, I present our work in finding and analysing symmetries of fractals associated to iterated function systems and to study the C*-algebras that arise from the dynamics. Our starting point is Stricharz's construction of a family of fractafold blowups of the invariant set of an iterated function system which is parameterized by a Cantor set.  We assemble these fractafold blowups  into a fractafold bundle. In general there do not appear to be any natural nontrivial symmetries of a generic blowup but Stricharz's observation suggests that we look for symmetries of the bundle instead. Indeed we show that there is a natural groupoid action on the fractafold bundle. This groupoid action and the associated action groupoid constitute the main objects of this presentation.

<h4>Dynamical systems, operator algebras, and the structure of the unitaries</h4>

Can one embed the simplex with vertices indexed by the permutation group Sn into the unitary group U(n) in a natural way? If you can answer this open question then you have proven that two operator algebras are isometrically isomorphic if and only if their associated dynamical systems are piecewise conjugate.

In these two talks I plan on tracing the history of these problems with the intention of revealing the strong connection between these three areas.

<h4>On spectra of sums</h4>


I'll provide spectral characterizations of sums of elements of a unital algebra over a field when certain pairwise products of the summands are zero.  Applying these characterizations in the context of the Calkin Algebra yields descriptions of essential spectra of composition operators on the Hardy space whose symbols belong to the class S(2) introduced by Kriete and Moorhouse.

<h4>A convex structure on Hom spaces of von Neumann algebras</h4>


As a parallel to the semigroup structure of extensions of
C*-algebras in BDF theory, we follow a recent paper of Nate Brown and show how a convex structure can be placed
on Hom(N,R<sup>&omega;</sup>)--the space of unital *-homomorphisms from N to R<sup>&omega;</sup> modulo unitary equivalence. Here N is a
separable II<sub>1</sub> factor and R<sup>&omega;</sup> is an ultrapower of the hyperfinite
II<sub>1</sub> factor.  Extreme points in this structure will be characterized, and a
(nontrivial) dynamical system will be introduced.  We will also briefly
discuss some possible generalizations/derivatives of this idea (e.g. allow
more than just II<sub>1</sub> factors in the first argument, change equivalence
relation, etc.).

<h4>Unitary equivalence of C*-algebras generated by composition operators on the Hardy and weighted Bergman spaces</h4>

<p>In this talk, we will investigate the unitary equivalence of a class of weighted composition operators on the Hardy and weighted Bergman spaces.  These results establish a strong unitary equivalence between the C*-algebras generated by a composition operator C<sub>&phi;</sub> and the ideal of compact operators on the corresponding spaces in the case that &phi; is a linear-fractional, non-automorphism self-map of the unit disk that fixes a point on the unit circle.  Thus, the structure theorems for these C*-algebras in the Hardy space setting transfer to the weighted Bergman space setting.

<h4>A brief review on Carleson type embeddings</h4>

<p>Let H<sup>2</sup> be the Hardy space of the unit disc <b>D</b> of the complex plane. A famous theorem of Carleson characterizes the positive and finite Borel measures m on <b>D</b> such that the space H<sup>2</sup> embeds continuously into L<sup>2</sup>(m). In this talk, we briefly review some results of this type for some other spaces of analytic functions on <b>D</b>. In particular, we pay attention to the case of the de Branges-Rovnyak spaces. We also discuss some recent reversed embeddings results.

<p>A part of this talk is based on joint works with A. Baranov, A. Blandign&egrave;res, F. Gaunard, A. Hartmann, J. Mashreghi and W. Ross.

<h4>Powers and direct sums of operators</h4>

Partly because of a lingering desire to explore multiplicity
theory for non-normal operators and partly out of curiosity, we explore the
relationship between the square of an operator and its direct sum with
itself. This involves the strong use of analytic function theory.

<h4>The generator problem for C*-algebras</h4>

The generator problem asks to determine for a given C*-algebra the
minimal number of generators, i.e., elements that are not contained in a
proper C*-subalgebra. It is conjectured that every separable, simple
C*-algebra is generated by a single element. The generator problem was
originally asked for von Neumann algebras, and Kadison included it as
Nr. 14 of his famous list of 20 “Problems on von Neumann algebras”. The
general problem is still open, most notably for the free group factors.

<p>With Wilhelm Winter, we proved that every a unital, separable C*-algebra
is generated by a single element if it tensorially absorbs the Jiang-Su
algebra. This generalized most previous results about the generator
problem for C*-algebras.

<p>In a different approach to the generator problem, we define a notion of
`generator rank', in analogy to the real rank. Instead of asking if a
certain C*-algebra A is generated by k elements, the generator rank
records whether the generating k-tuples of A are dense. It turns out
that this invariant has good permanence properties, for instance it
passes to inductive limits. It follows that every AF-algebra is singly
generated, and even more the set of generators is generic (a dense
G_delta-set).

<h4>Dilations and constrained algebras</h4>

It is well known that unital contractive representations of the disk algebra are completely contractive. It is also known that this result holds for the annulus algebra (Agler), and fails for triply connected domains (Dritschel-McCullough, Agler-Harman-Raphael).  In this talk I will consider some further examples of hypo-Dirichlet algebras for which the answer is now known, both in the negative (the subalgebra of the disk algebra consisting of those functions f whose first derivative vanishes at 0), and in the affirmative (the algebra of rational functions with poles off the distinguished variety V in the bidisk determined by z<sup>2</sup>=w<sup>2</sup>); the latter may be seen as a limiting case of Agler's rational dilation theorem for the annulus. (This is joint work with Michael Dritschel and Scott McCullough.)
