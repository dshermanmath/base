<h4>Operator algebras for analytic varieties </h4>

<p>

To an analytic variety V one can consider the restriction of the multiplier algebra of Drury-Arveson space to V.
The goal of these two talks is to show that two such operator algebras are completely isometrically isomorphic if and only if there is an automorphism of the ball taking one variety onto the other.

<h4>Basic notions of free probability (Part 1 of 2)</h4>

<p>In Part 1, we will first set up the basic framework of
non-commutative probability and discuss some basic notions of this topic
with examples.  The notion of free independence will be introduced and
contrasted with classical (tensor) independence.  To illustrate this
contrast, we will exhibit combinatorial proofs of the Central Limit Theorem
when either of these two notions of independence is considered.

<p>               Looking ahead to Part 2, there are a number of possible
topics we may discuss, including but not limited to: computations using the
free central limit theorem, the surprising result of Wigner's theorem for
large random matrices, the relation between free independence and
non-crossing partitions via free cumulants, free convolution, and the
R-transform.

<h4>Basic notions of free probability (Part 2 of 2)
</h4>

<p>
We will begin by completing the proof of the Central Limit
Theorems in this algebraic context.  As we will see in this proof,
non-crossing partitions of n arise naturally from free independence.  We
will go on to examine this relationship between non-crossing partitions and
free independence by looking at the concept of free cumulants (related to
moments via the moment-cumulant formula).  These free cumulants will let us
study free convolution and the related R-transform (this is the free analog
of the logarithm of the Fourier transform).  We will use these ideas to
discuss the free convolution of two projections and the free analog of the
Poisson distribution.

<h4>Characters and II<sub>1</sub> Factor Representations of Thompson's group </h4>

A character of an infinite group G is defined as a
positive-definite class function. In view of the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal
construction, characters are in one-to-one correspondence with finite (in
the sense of Murray-von Neumann) von Neumann algebra representations of the
group.  Characters of a group form a Choquet simplex with extreme
characters  being in one-to-one correspondence with type II_1 factor
representations of the group in question.

<p>

Studying the representation theory of the infinite symmetric group
S(&infin;), Vershik noticed that many of its characters come from  ergodic
actions of  S(&infin;) on  measure spaces (X,&mu;) by the formula f(g) =
&mu;(FixedPoints(g)).  The question we are trying to address is for which
infinite groups all of the characters can be given a similar dynamical
interpretation.

<p>

We will reexamine  some older results on classification of characters of
such groups as Special Linear Group of Infinite Matrices over a finite
field and Groups of Rational Permutation of the unit interval. We will then
classify  characters  of locally finite groups determined by Bratteli
diagrams and the Higman-Thompson groups. In the case of (the commutator of)
a Higman-Thompson group, based on the fact that its natural action on the unit
interval has no invariant measures, we will show that this group has no
non-trivial characters. As a result, the only non-trivial II<sub>1</sub> factor
representation of it is the group von Neumann algebra. The absence of
non-trivial characters has some implications in the theory of random
subgroups.

<h4>Equivalent operator categories</h4>

<p>Leaving rigorous definitions to the talk, <i>operator categories</i> are natural classes that include C*-algebras, operator systems, hereditary manifolds, operator algebras, Jordan operator algebras, etc.  I will show how to associate the following features to any such category: an operator topology, a representation theory, and a convexity/dilation theory.  It turns out that if one of these features agrees for a pair of categories, then all three do, in which case the categories are called equivalent.  I will discuss some equivalences, along the way obtaining new observations about Arveson's hyperrigidity and maybe even triangles.

<h4>Every matrix is a product of Toeplitz matrices</h4>

Recently Ye and Lim showed that every matrix can be written as a product of Toeplitz matrices. In this talk, I will outline a proof of this result. I will also discuss the maximal algebras within the Toeplitz matrices and show how some alterations of the Ye and Lim proof will show that the n by n matrices can be written as a product of maximal algebras of Toeplitz matrices.

<h4>Inverse continuity of the numerical range map
</h4>

<p>The numerical range of a matrix has many applications in linear algebra, physics, and engineering. The numerical range is the image of the complex unit n-sphere under the quadratic map [x maps to x*Ax].  Recently there has been interest in the pre-images of this numerical range map.  I will discuss the continuity properties of the multivalued inverse of the numerical range map. Along the way, we will revisit some of the classical results concerning the numerical range.

<h4>Forcing Axioms and Baire Category Theorem</h4>

<p>
The Baire Category Theorem (BCT) states that in certain
topological spaces, the intersection of countably many open dense sets is
dense.  "Forcing Axioms" assert that for a wide class of Stone Spaces, the
"countably many" requirement in the BCT can be relaxed.  Forcing Axioms can
neither be proved nor disproved in classical mathematics, but have many
interesting consequences; e.g. Farah proved that Forcing Axioms imply there
are no outer automorphisms of the Calkin algebra.  I will discuss Forcing
Axioms and their enemy, Jensen's Diamond Principle.

<h4>Naimark's problem: a primer</h4>

<p>We know that every irreducible representation of the compact operators on a
Hilbert space is unitarily equivalent to the identity representation.  In
1951, Naimark asked if the converse was true, and this came to be known as
Naimark's problem.  We will discuss the history of Naimark's problem,
including results of Rosenberg and Glimm.  We will discuss a criterion for
unique extensions of pure states due to Anderson and then introduce an
important crossed product construction utilizing the homogeneity of the
state space of separable C*-algebras (Futamura, Kataoka, and Kishimoto
2001, Kishimoto, Ozawa, and Sakai 2003).  In a subsequent talk we will present
the 2004 construction of a counterexample to Naimark's problem due to
Akemann and Weaver.

<h4>Naimark's problem: the counterexample</h4>

<p>In a previous talk we discussed the history of Naimark's problem.  In this
talk we will work through the construction of a counterexample to Naimark's
problem: a C*-algebra with only one irreducible representation up to
unitary equivalence which is not *-isomorphic to the compact operators on
a Hilbert space.  This construction is due to Akemann and Weaver in 2004
and utilizes Jensen's diamond principle, which is known to be independent
of ZFC.
