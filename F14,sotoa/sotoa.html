<h4>Automorphisms of the free product of disk algebras
</h4>
<p>
In complex topology there is lovely structure theorem due to Rudin, Ligocka and Tsyganov saying that an automorphism of a product of spaces is just a product of automorphisms in each space and a permutation of the spaces in the product. Such an automorphism of the polydisk naturally produces an isometric automorphism of the free product of disk algebras. We will prove that there are no other isometric automorphisms.

<h4>Operator algebras and multivariable dynamics</h4>
<p>
To a dynamical system comprised of a compact Hausdorf space and <i>n</i> proper continuous maps one can associate a universal operator algebra. We will show that this universal operator algebra completely characterizes the dynamical system up to a natural form of conjugacy.

<h4>Stabilized Krivine p's</h4>
<p>


In the early 1970s Jean-Louis Krivine showed that for each basic sequence
(x<sub>n</sub>) in a Banach space there is a p in the interval [1,&infin;] so that l<sub>p</sub>
is block finitely represented in (x<sub>n</sub>). It has since been conjectured by
several authors that any `stabilized' Krivine set of a Banach space must be
an interval. In this talk we will discuss the history of the problem and
explain how to construct a wide ranging collection of counterexamples. This
is joint work with Dan Freeman and Pavlos Motakis.

<h4>Majorization and the Schur-Horn theorem</h4>
<p>
Using my lawn sprinkler, I will explain what it means for one real <i>n</i>-tuple to <i>majorize</i> another.  The Schur-Horn theorem says that this is exactly the same as the existence of a self-adjoint matrix with the first tuple as eigenvalue list and the second tuple as diagonal.  I'll discuss the theorem and the ongoing quest for generalizations and variations (e.g., Gary Weiss's lecture next week).  

<p>This talk will be accessible to nonspecialists.

<h4>Diagonality and idempotents, Jasper's frame theory problem, and Schur-Horn theorems</h4>

<p>We explore various relations of operators to their diagonals which study we coin diagonality and explain.
This will include how to use 0-diagonality (operators with zero diagonal in some basis) to answer a frame theory question
equivalent to an idempotent question of Jasper's, for which I will give some background.

<p>Then we will explore recent and past work on Schur Horn theorems on possible diagonals a positive compact operator can have.

<p>I hope to give an overview of some core steps in the development of both.
This work was inspired by work of Gohberg, Markus, Arveson, Kadison, Jasper, Fan, Fong, Herrero, and others, which will be explained.

<h4>Pre-orders, partial orders, and partial isometric matrices</h4>
<p>
The first part of this talk will be a survey on the topic of partial isometric matrices, dating back to gems of P. Halmos and I. Erdelyi.  By a complex analysis gem of S. Takenaka, we will also explore their representation as compressed shifts on spaces of rational functions. The second part of the talk will focus on certain pre-orders and partial orders one can place on the partial isometric matrices. All of this relates to a problem first explored by Bruce Crofoot on classifying the multipliers from one model space to another. Though, for the sake of simplicity, we will focus on the partial isometric matrices, there are versions of these results for partial isometries on Hilbert spaces. They will be alluded to at various times during the talk. This is joint work with Rob Martin, Stephan Garcia, Yi Guo, and Zezhong Chen.

<h4>Korovkin-type properties for completely positive maps</h4>

<p>
Let S be an operator system in B(H) and let A be its
generated C*-algebra.
We give a new characterization of Arveson's unique extension property for
unital completely positive maps in terms of rigidity with respect to
sequences ucp maps. We also show that if every irreducible representation
of a Type I C*-algebra A generated by an operator system S is a boundary
representation, then every ucp map on A with codomain A" that fixes S also
fixes A. This is related to Arveson's "hyperrigidity conjecture" on a
noncommutative version of Saskin's classical result on Choquet boundaries
and Korovkin sets. We will discuss the basic ideas and definitions of
operator systems, completely positive maps, and noncommutative Choquet
theory.

<h4>The conformal equivalence of polynomials and finite Blaschke products: A tale of three proofs</h4>

For any complex polynomial p of one complex variable, if G is a tract of the polynomial (that is, a component of the set {z:|p(z)| less than r} for some positive r) then it is easy to show that if h is the Riemann map for G, then the composition of p with h is a finite Blaschke product on the unit disk (thus we would say that p is conformally equivalent to a finite Blaschke product on G).  I will discuss three different proofs (two analytic and one geometric) going the other direction, showing that every finite Blaschke product is in fact conformally equivalent to some polynomial.

<h4>Complex symmetric operators: a quick overview</h4>
<p>

Complex symmetric operators are a surprisingly large class of (typically) non-normal operators that arise frequently at the intersection of complex analysis and operator theory.  We highlight a number of examples and several key results.  This talk will be accessible to graduate students.

<h4>Pseudocompact C*-algebras</h4>
<p>

Certain limits of finite-dimensional C*-algebras (i.e. direct sums of
matrix algebras), such as AF and UHF C*-algebras and the compact operators,
are particularly well understood.  We are interested in the class of
logical limits of finite-dimensional C*-algebras, which are called
pseudocompact C*-algebras.  We will discuss results due to Henson and Moore
in the Banach space case, some finiteness properties pseudocompact
C*-algebras have, and conclude with some questions.
