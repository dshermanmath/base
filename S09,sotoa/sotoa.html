<h4>Inversion of Ahlfors and Grunsky inequalities</h4>

<p>
The classical Ahlfors inequalty (of 1952) <i>1/&rho;<sub>L</sub> &le; q<sub>L</sub></i>
for closed oriented Jordan curves <i>L</i> on the sphere
is fundamental in the theory of Fredholm eigenvalues; here <i>q<sub>L</sub></i>
is the reflection coefficient of <i>L</i> and <i>&rho;<sub>L</sub></i> is its first nontrivial
eigenvalue. It is intrinsically connected with the strengthened
Grunsky inequality for the Grunsky and Teichm&uuml;ller norms of
functions with quasiconformal extensions.
</p>

<p>
The long standing problem of inversion of these inequalities was solved
only recently by applying geometric methods involving the complex
geometry of universal Teichm&uuml;ller space (space of deformation of
conformal structures) and the curvature properties of general
Finsler metrics.  I will briefly outline the main ideas and arguments.

<h4>The inverse Jordan problem for truncated Toeplitz operators</h4>

<p>Is every <i>n</i>&times;<i>n</i> matrix similar to a Toeplitz matrix? In general the answer is no. However, every <i>n</i>&times;<i>n</i> matrix is similar to a truncated Toeplitz operator.

<h4>A survey of the representation theory of C*-algebras</h4>

<p>In this talk, I will discuss the representation theory for various classes of C*-algebras.  In this context, we will associate to each C*-algebra two important objects -- the spectrum and the primitive ideal space.  The degree to which these objects agree has interesting implications regarding representations.

<h4>Groupoid C*-algebras</h4>

<p>One method operator algebraists developed to better understand C*-algebras is to build them from simpler objects. For example, we can construct a C*-algebra from a group, a group action, and a directed graph.  In all three of these cases, properties of the C*-algebra directly correspond to properties of the object  from which they were built.  In this talk, I will describe how to build a C*-algebra from a groupoid.  Groupoid C*-algebras  are generalizations of group, group action, and graph algebras.    I will start out by defining what is meant by a groupoid, giving a number of examples.   Next I will describe the process of building a C*-algebra from a groupoid.  Finally, time permitting, I will show some results in which topological properties of the groupoid  characterize the spectrum of the associated groupoid C*-algebra.

<h4>A survey of the representation theory of C*-algebras, part 2</h4>

<p>Let A be a C*-algebra. For the second part of this survey, we'll examine in some detail the topological structure of Prim(A) and &Acirc;. This will lead to a discussion of continuous trace C*-algebras.</p>

<h4>C*-algebras generated by isometries</h4>

<p>We will define and explore both old and new results on C*-algebras generated by isometries, which include the Cuntz algebras and so-called graph algebras. In particular, we will mention some of the recent work by Kirchberg that has used Cuntz algebras to characterize separable nuclear C*-algebras.

<h4>Jordan structures in Banach space theory and operator space theory</h4>

<p>In the sixties, Douglas proved that an isometric copy of L<sup>1</sup> in a second L<sup>1</sup> space is always contractively complemented. In the eighties, Kirchberg generalized this result to von Neumann algebras, showing that an isometric copy of the predual of a von Neumann algebra inside the predual of a second von Neumann algebra is always contractively complemented. Thus, preduals of von Neumann algebras are said to be <i>projectively rigid</i>. However, unlike L<sup>1</sup> spaces they are not <i>projectively stable</i>, i.e. the range of a normal contractive projection on a von Neumann algebra is not isometric to another von Neumann algebra but is isometric to a more general structure called a JBW*-triple. JBW*-triples are of independent interest as exactly those dual Banach spaces whose unit ball has a transitive biholomorphic automorphism group. They are known to be contractively stable. In this talk we will completely solve the above projective rigidity problem for JBW*-triples. We will also review the long history of these types of problems involving many authors in many different settings.</p>

<p>In the second part of the talk we will focus on results in operator space theory that use JBW*-triple theory. We give results about the operator space structure of the range of a contractive projection on B(H). In particular, we give a classification of Hilbert spaces that arise in this way. We will show the first known operator space classification of unital operator spaces. We also give an operator space classification of ternary rings of operators, which are fundamental invariants in the theory.</p>

<p>This is joint work with David Blecher, Bernard Russo, and Eric Ricard.</p>

<h4>Ultraproducts in analysis and model theory</h4>
This is a continuation of the previous week's talk. I'll start with some discussion of the tracial ultraproduct construction for operator algebras, which is an important variation on the Banach space ultraproduct introduced last week. Neither of these ultraproducts is the same as the "classical" ultraproduct of model theory, and powerful theorems from logic do not directly apply to them. Then I'll sketch a wonderful hybrid approach which makes versions of the logical theorems available in the analytic context. This will give the audience some extra background for Ward Henson's colloquium on April 2.

<h4>A C*-algebra generated by Fourier multipliers and Toeplitz operators, and its application to composition operators</h4>

<p>By the help of the Paley-Wiener theorem we construct a C*-algebra generated by Fourier multipliers and Toeplitz operators on the Hardy space of the upper half-plane.  And by the help of Cauchy integral formula we observe that a certain class of composition operators fall in this C*-algebra.  We also transfer the results to the Hardy space of the unit disc.

<h4>An introduction to crossed products of C*-algebras</h4>

<p>In this expository talk, we will explore the crossed products of C*-algebras by locally compact topological groups. We will begin by reviewing basic facts about topological groups and by looking at the group C*-algebra to motivate the crossed product construction. We will then build the crossed product and consider a few basic examples.
